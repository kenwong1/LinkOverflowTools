    # within 10 seconds, but we wait until the VM has fully passed status checks, which might take many minutes.
    # The end user shouldn't be permitted to connect to it with SSH until it's fully running, so this is where we need to wait.

    # will be ready immediately after the first instance is ready, since they're booting up in parallel. However, if one of
